Here's a summary of what each file does at the moment:


-----
PyPhagea.py

is the main library for the python functions


-----
phageaFig1.py

creates the first sort of composite plot we used in this project. 
Turns on and off replenish, rescale and randinit facilities - intended to show what these do in the figures.
